# Dog Fetcher

A coding exercise built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/).

## Limitations
If I had more time, or if I was creating a production application, here are some of the things I would add: 

* Functionality for filtering and sorting by location, which would no doubt be useful for a real dog-adoption app.

* An image processing service to support muliple image sizes and types to improve page-load performance. 

* More tests! I've included some component tests, but in a production application I would increase code coverage as well adding end-to-end tests.

* I would also consider moving React Contact for "like" handling
